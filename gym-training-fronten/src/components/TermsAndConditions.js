            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to Dupla. By accessing or using our mobile application and website, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.</p>

            <h2>2. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
            <p>Dupla offers various subscription plans for coaches. By selecting a plan, you agree to pay the stated fees.</p>

            <h2>3. Refund Policy</h2>
            <p><strong>All sales are final.</strong> We do not offer refunds or credits for partial subscription periods, unused services, or accidental purchases.</p>
            <p>Since Dupla provides immediate access to digital tools and content, we cannot issue refunds once a subscription has been active.</p>

            <h2>4. Cancellations</h2>
            <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time. Your access will continue until the end of the current billing cycle, after which your account will revert to the free tier or be restricted.</p>

            <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at duplatraining@gmail.com.</p>
